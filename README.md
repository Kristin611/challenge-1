# Challenge 1: Refactor Horiseon

## Description
The purpose of this project is to improve the accessibility of Horiseon's website. 
By making a website more accessible, people with physical disabilities have greater access to it. Accessibility also improves a website's position in search engine results, increasing the website's overall traffic. 
Finally, the more accessible a company's website is the better they can avoid litigation. 

As a boot camp student I learned how the alt tag increases the accessibility of websites.

I also learned about the importance of structure and organization in HTML and how the CSS should reflect the organization of HTML.

Note: the peers that I worked with on this project are Nick Amaro, Grace Kiker, Carly C., and Raul Serpas.
